# Who am I

I am Mark, a Lead Developer with twenty years of development experience. I've led development teams through an entire enterprise payroll solution rewrite from desktop to cloud, I've been the .NET lead on a number of commercial websites using technology such as ASP.NET, .NET Core, SQL Server and EPiServer CMS.

I am a Ceroc/Modern Jive Dancer and I help beginners in embracing the start of their dancing journey and I met my fabulous wife on the dance-floor. I'm into roller skating and currently train with Aire Force One, a men's Roller Derby team based in Leeds.
