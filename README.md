I am an experienced lead developer and team leader with over 23 years of experience within the software development industry. I have worked with both cross functional teams and project teams across a variety of Agile software delivery methodologies including Scrum, Kanban and SAFe. I make it my aim to encourage and empower my colleagues so that we may collaborate and evolve as a team through continuous improvement.

I am a Platinum Optimizely Most Valuable Professional as of August 2022. This was achieved by developing two of my own plugins for Optimizely CMS 12 as well as playing an active part within the Optimizely Developer community.
