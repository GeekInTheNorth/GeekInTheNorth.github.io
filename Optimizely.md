# Optimizely

[Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com) is the industry leader in digital experience platforms. Their product suite is known as Optimizely One and it is described as the world's first operating system for marketing and digital teams.  Optimizely One combines solutions across content management, content marketing, experimentation, commerce and personalization. It powers every stage of the marketing lifecycle through an AI-accelerated workflow.

As an Optimizely Most Valuable Professional, I contribute to the development community by providing solutions, writing blogs and creating two packages for their Content Management System: [Stott Robots Handler](https://github.com/GeekInTheNorth/Stott.Optimizely.RobotsHandler) and [Stott Security](https://github.com/GeekInTheNorth/Stott.Security.Optimizely).
