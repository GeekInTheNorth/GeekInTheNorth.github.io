# The Day We Upset Anthony Stewart Head

Published: 1st September 2024

Back in August of 2014, I went to the first Sheffield Film and Comic Convention with my then soon to be fiance Caroline and my best friend Teddy.  It was my first proper Comic Convention and I would go on to actors from many of my favourite series and get a question answered in every single Q&A session we went to.  I nerded out with [Armin Shimerman](/article/meeting_the_ferengi), Kitty Swink (his wife) and Chase Masterson (his co-star from Star Trek Deep Space 9).  I got to meet Sylvester McCoy who was my primary Doctor in Doctor Who when I was growing up.  It was also the day that we upset [Anthony Stewart Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Head)...

I first became aware of Anthony Stewart Head back when he was part of a long running and famous [Nescafe Gold Blend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Blend_couple) ad campaign in the late 80s and early 90s.  In those days we didn't have an option to skip the ads and genuinely everyone became invested in the serialised romance of the couple in the campaign.  Fast forward a few years to the release of [Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer) I said what I imagine many people said "hey it's the coffee guy!".

Over 20 years later, I still consider Buffy The Vampire Slayer to be the best young adult horror TV series.  Antony Stewart Head played Rupert Giles, a member of a secret organisation called The Watchers and masquerading as a school Librarian with a hidden dark past.  Rupert Giles trained the teenage Buffy the Vampire Slayer and her friends and became the mentor and surrogate father to the group. Antony Stewart Head's performance in this role was excellent.

The next show I became fully invested in that starred Anthony Stewart Head was the BBC TV Series [Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(2008_TV_series)) which ran from 2008 to 2012.  In this show Anthony played Uther Pendragon, the father of Prince Arthur Pendragon.  It was a role that was in stark contrast to his role as Rupert Giles and he excelled in this role.

In 2014, he had a role in the TV Show [Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(TV_series)) which was based on the 2010 movie Legion.  This was the first time I heard Anthony Stewart Head use his american accent for role.  Ultimately I checked out of this show by the forth episode, I didn't find the main character to be likeable and I didn't enjoy the storyline.

Jumping back to Sheffield Film and Comic Convention, we had purchased early access tickets.  This allowed us to enter the convention hall an hour ahead of the main crowd and seeing that Anthony Stewart Head was already at his table and the queue was only just starting to form.  We joined in and there were maybe a dozen people in front of us.  I watched Anthony shaking hands with everyone in front of us and naturally I entered full geek mode getting ready to meet him and shake his hand.

When it was my turn, I went into full geek mode and enthused about how much I enjoyed his performances in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Merlin and Little Britain as he was writing on my chosen picture.  Anthony then asked "Have you had a chance to watch Dominion yet?".  With this being Anthony's latest work, he was of course always going to ask about it.  It was at this point I started to transition from geek mode to panic mode.  I rambled about having just started it a transition that was rapid as Caroline piped up with "He really doesn't like it".  Anthony stopped writing on the photo, put his pen down and sat back with his arms crossed.  Caroline swiftly added "He doesn't like your accent in it.".  Both statements were of course entirely true of my opinion, I'd expressed them 10 minutes earlier at the back of the queue.  I rambled on for what felt like 5 minutes but was clearly shorter as I tried (unsuccessfully) to recover the situation.  Anthony ultimately finished signing the photo once he had secured my promise to give Dominion another go and it became someone elses turn.  I didn't get a handshake, but the next person did.

Caroline had paid for a photo opportunity with Anthony Stewart Head, so later that day we stood in the queue and when it became her turn, I'll always remember him looking at me and saying "Oh ... it's you!". In my head I was left questioning whether he'd seen the tweet I'd tagged him in when Domion first aired, was my guilt now fully laid bare? 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why cast <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonySHead?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AnthonySHead</a> and then not allow him to use his own accent? the producers of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dominion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dominion</a> have shot themselves in the foot!</p>&mdash; Mark Stott (@GeekInTheNorth) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeekInTheNorth/status/481143246983548928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I still haven't given Dominion a second go, but I am rewatching Buffy the Vampire Slayer (again) on Disney+ ... he's amazing in it.

## Epilogue

At the time, I do remember feeling embarrassed and a little frustrated at the encounter with Anthony Stewart Head and on reflection I should have just been more open and tactful about it.
